This computer module is a GPU and allows you to render a character grid onto any kind of screen.
Each character can have it's own background and foreground color.

You can also change the resolution to up to 150x50 characters.

If the bound monitor allows for it, the GPU can also have user input like mouse clicks,
keyboard key strokes or just simple mouse movement over the screen.
"Touch input" by looking/clicking with the crosshair over/onto a screen in the world is also supported.
