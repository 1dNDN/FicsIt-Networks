|===

This computer module is a GPU and allows you to render a character grid onto any kind of screen.
Each character can have it's own background and foreground color.

You can also change the resolution to up to 150x50 characters.

If the bound monitor allows for it, the GPU can also have user input like mouse clicks,
keyboard key strokes or just simple mouse movement over the screen.
"Touch input" by looking/clicking with the crosshair over/onto a screen in the world is also supported.

To define the color of a character, you need to set the currently used foreground and background color.
All further character changes cause the changed character to have the currently used foreground and background colors.
If you change the currently used foreground and background color, the color of the already drawn/changed characters
wont change. (Until you draw them again)

When you do changes, those changes will only occur on a hidden buffer.
That means you need to call `flush()` after you have changes something and want to display it.

=== Functions

==== `flush()`

Copies the hidden buffer data to the rendered one so you commit screen changes to the visible layer.

==== `setSize(int width, int height)`

This function allows you to change the screen size of the monitor.
If the screen size stays the same nothing will happen but if it does,
the screen will get cleared and the `ScreenSizeChange` signal will get emitted.

Parameters::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|width
|int
|the new width of the character grid

|height
|int
|the new height of the character grid
|===

==== `width, height getSize()`

This function allows you to get the current screen size of the monitor.

Parameters::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|width
|int
|the width of the character grid

|height
|int
|the height of the character grid
|===

==== `setForeground(number r, number g, number b, number a)`

This function allows you to set the used foreground color of all following draw calls.

Parameters::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|r
|number
|the red value of the foreground color from 0 to 1

|g
|number
|the green value of the foreground color from 0 to 1

|b
|number
|the blue value of the foreground color from 0 to 1

|a
|number
|the alpha/transparency value of the foreground color from 0 to 1
|===

==== `setBackground(number r, number g, number b, number a)`

This function allows you to set the used background color of all following draw calls.

Parameters::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|r
|number
|the red value of the background color from 0 to 1

|g
|number
|the green value of the background color from 0 to 1

|b
|number
|the blue value of the background color from 0 to 1

|a
|number
|the alpha/transparency value of the background color from 0 to 1
|===

==== `setText(int x, int y, string text)`

This function allows you to set the text at the the given char grid location.
The `\n` character causes the cursor to move to the next line directly under the latest draw.
The `\r` character causes the cursor to move to the beginning of the line.

Parameters::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|x
|int
|the x coordinate where the given text should get drawn to

|y
|int
|the y coordinate where the given text should get drawn to

|text
|string
|the string you want to draw at the given coordinates
|===

==== `fill(int x, int y, int w, int h, string char)`

This function fills the rectangle at the given location with the given size with the given character.
The rectangle starts at the given coordinates and then spans out to the given lengths right and down,
so the coordinates are not centerd in the rectangle, the coordinates are the upper left corner of the rectangle.

If the character is a control key or the char string is longer than 1, ` `(space) is used instead as character.

Parameters::
+
[cols="1,1,4a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Description

|x
|int
|the x coordinate of the upper left corner of the rectangle

|y
|int
|the y coordinate of the upper left corner of the rectangle

|w
|int
|the width of the rectangle

|h
|int
|the height of the rectangle

|char
|string
|the character you want to fill the rectangle with
|===

=== Signals

==== Button bit-field

The mouse events allso provide a parameter allowing you to check if the event occured with what
control keys (like ctrl, shift, alt or cmd) down and which mouse button triggered the signal.

This happens by turning individual bits of the provided integer on or off. On means "key is pressed".
The buttons are listed from least significant bit to most significant:
- Left Mouse Button
- Right Mouse Button
- Ctrl Key
- Shift Key
- Alt Key
- Cmd Key

You can use the https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#3.4.2[Bitwise Or Operator] to check if a given key is pressed:

[source,Lua]
----
bitField = 21 -- Left Mouse & Ctrl & Alt
if bitField & 1 > 0 then
 -- left mouse pressed
end
if bitField & 2 > 0 then
 -- right mouse pressed
end
if bitField & 4 > 0 then
 -- ctrl pressed
end
if bitField & 8 > 0 then
 -- shift pressed
end
if bitField & 16 > 0 then
 -- alt pressed
end
if bitField & 32 > 0 then
 -- cmd pressed
end
----
