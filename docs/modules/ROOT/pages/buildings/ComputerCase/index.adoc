= Computer Case
:description: The computer case is the core of computer technology. It allows you to build a custom PC with modules to make a computer that fits your needs.

The Computer Case allows you to build dynamically a computer with different modules.
Each module provides then a functionallity you might need like a processor or RAM.
The Computer Case is like the mother board which connects all the different modules together
and is then capable of running programs.

It also manages the EEPROM, you need at least one EEPROM which then holds the boot code of the computer.
The type of EEPROM varies between processor types, because different processors use different types of code.

You need exactly one processor for the computer case to work.

== PCI-Interface
The PCI-Interface of a computer allows addressing/referencing computer components directly. +
`PCI-Devices` is the name for this kind computer components. +
This Interface usually is exposed by the computers kernel and the specific CPU implementation.
It should provide a function that allows you to retrieve a list of,
in the computer case currently installed PCI-Devices of a given type. +
Have a look at xref:/lua/examples/PCIDevices.adoc[this] example to see how it is done in Lua.
