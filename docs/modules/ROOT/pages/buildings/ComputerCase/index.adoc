The Computer Case allows you to build dynamically a computer with different modules.
Each module provides then a functionallity you might need like a processor or RAM.
The Computer Case is like the mother board which connects all the different modules together
and is then capable of running programs.

It also manages the EEPROM, you need at least one EEPROM which then holds the boot code of the computer.
The type of EEPROM varies between processor types, because different processors use different types of code.

You need exactly one processor for the computer case to work.
