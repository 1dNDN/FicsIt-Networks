The splitter allows you to control the flow of items.

It has one conveyor input and three outputs.

It has a input inventory, when its empty one item autmatically gets transferd from the input to the inventory.

Each output also has its own output inventory, were the code can move items from the input inventory into it.
If the inventory is full, the code can't move any further item into the output inventory.
As long as the output inventory contains a item the corresponding conveyor output can grab these items.
