The Speaker Pole is a network component buildable wich provides the functionallity to play custom sound files ingame.

With the speaker you can create f.e. a alert sound when you run low on Modular Frames.

If you want to add a sound, open your saves folder, go to the `Computers\Sounds` folder and place your sound file as ogg in there. You don't even need to restart your game, you can directly use it. Subfolders are also allowed.
