= Paint Example

This small programm uses a GPU and a Screen to make a small paint programm ingame.

In the lower left corner you can choose between five different colors (clear, red, green, blue and white)
by simply clicking with your mouse onto one.

After that you can begin to draw on the screen with that selected color, by click and holding the mouse button
and then moving the mouse around. To stop drawing simply release the mouse button.

== Setup

You need small computer with a Lua CPU, a little bit RAM, a Screen Driver and GPU T1.
Then just plug in a Lua EEPROM and fill it with the code below.
Then just run it and switch to the computer screen and have some fun ^^

== Code

[source,Lua]

gpu = computer.getGPUs()[1]
screen = computer.getScreens()[1]
gpu:bindScreen(screen)

w,h=gpu:getSize()

gpu:setBackground(0,0,0,0)
gpu:fill(0,0,w,h," ", " ")

colors = {{0,0,0,0},{0,0,0,0},{1,0,0,1},{1,0,0,1},{0,1,0,1},{0,1,0,1},{0,0,1,1},{0,0,1,1},{1,1,1,1},{1,1,1,1}}

for i, color in ipairs(colors) do
 gpu:setBackground(color[1],color[2],color[3],color[4])
 gpu:setText(i-1,h-1," ")
end

event.listen(gpu)

gpu:setBackground(1,1,1,1)

isDown = false
while true do
 e,s,x,y = event.pull()
 if e == "OnMouseDown" then
  isDown = true
  if y == h-1 and x < #colors then
   color = colors[x+1]
   gpu:setBackground(color[1],color[2],color[3],color[4])
  end
 elseif e == "OnMouseUp" then
  isDown = false
 elseif e == "OnMouseMove" and not (y == h-1 and x < #colors) and isDown then
  gpu:setText(x,y," ")
 end
 gpu:flush()
end
