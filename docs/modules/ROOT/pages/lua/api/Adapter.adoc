= Adapter API
:description: The Adapter API allows you to interact all sorts of things in the game.

The Adapter API mainly provides a baisc interface for all things that are not heavily specialized but can be accessed by anything.
This page mainly holds basic types and more specialized types are out-sourced to differnt doc pages like the Vehicle API.
