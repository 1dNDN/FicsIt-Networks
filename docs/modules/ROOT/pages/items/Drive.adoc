The Drive is used to get pluged in into a drive holder which allows a computer to read/write
data to the filesystem in the drive.

Such a drive has a GUID to identify the filesystem and use the address in the DevDevice.
This data is stored in the ItemState.

The different types of drives have different capacities to store data.

That means you can write data to the drive, unplug it, go to a different computer, plug it in
and then read this data. So you can transfer large amounts of data from one PC to another one.

Also, the data is persited over different computer sessions.
